Findings:

Publications surged after 2020.

A few journals dominated COVID-19 research publications.

Frequent words in titles include “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “health”, “clinical”.

Challenges:

Handling missing values in large real-world data.

Large dataset → requires filtering for performance in Streamlit.

Learning:

End-to-end pipeline: load → clean → analyze → visualize → app.

Streamlit makes publishing interactive dashboards easy.
